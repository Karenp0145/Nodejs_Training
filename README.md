# 🟢 LearnNode

This repository contains Node.js scripts from my first steps in learning backend JavaScript, exploring fundamental Node.js concepts through simple exercises.

---

## Overview

The exercises cover a variety of essential topics such as :

- JavaScript fundamentals in a Node.js environment  
- Modules and basic modularity  
- Asynchronous programming (`async / await`, Promises)  
- File system manipulation  
- Basic HTTP server creation  
- External npm package usage

## Covered Topics

### JavaScript Fundamentals
- Arrow functions  
- Variables and constants  
- Basic mathematical operations  
- Utility functions (calculator, BMI)

### Modules and Modularity
- Exporting and importing functions  
- Splitting logic across files  
- Reusable modules  

### Asynchronous Programming
- Promises and timers  
- `async / await` syntax  
- Sequential vs parallel execution  
- `Promise.all` for concurrency  

### File System (fs)
- Reading files asynchronously  
- Writing and appending files  
- File existence checks  
- Error handling with `try / catch`  

### External Libraries
- Using npm packages  
- ASCII art generation with `figlet`  

### Basic HTTP Server
- Creating a server with the native `http` module  
- Simple routing  
- HTML and JSON responses  
- 404 error handling
